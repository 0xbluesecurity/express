    main_content: "When we first began Dippies we had a simple goal in mind; to adopt a community first approach that holds a safe-space for all members. The process is simple but efficient. Peace, love and kindness toward others is a big part of who we are. Thats why our main objective is built around “how much value can we bring to our community?”. As this is a community driven project, we will be onboarding enthusiastic members of the community from day one. we plan on hosting AMA’s, organizing events, and maintaining 100% transparency at all times."
